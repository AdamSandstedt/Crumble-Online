I use UserSpice for user management and a lot of the php functionality like database queries and accessing 
the GET and POST parameters. (https://userspice.com/)



Instructions for running this code locally:

- Clone the repo
- In the cloned directory, run `docker compose up -d`
- Open up the site in your browser (http://localhost)
- The default admin login info for UserSpice is admin and password
- To stop it, run `docker compose down`
